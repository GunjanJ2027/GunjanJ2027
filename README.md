Greetings, I am [Gunjan Joshi]

Trained in the art of programming from the darkness, I mastered C++ as my weapon of choice. Gotham has its crime fighters; I have my algorithms.

Stepping into the night of Web Development—a new frontier. The web may be a tangled web, but I’m determined to bring order to the chaos.

Competitive Programming? It’s not a challenge; it’s a mission. I code in the dark, so others can see the light.

Seeking allies for the ultimate crusade in coding competitions. Alone, I am strong; together, we are unstoppable.

We don’t code because it’s easy. We code because we have to.
